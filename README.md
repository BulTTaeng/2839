made by Jaehyeok Choi

## Welcome to Jaehyeok's github!

## What is the problem?

![course_button](https://github.com/Choi-JaeHyeok-21500749/2839/blob/main/2839_pro.JPG)

## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming (Greedy algorithm)

## What was the key point and the hard part?

To use fewer bags, I have to use 5Kg bag first, if that is not possible, use 3Kg bag first and find out we can use 5Kg bag after.

To check impossible case, I have to make another value possilbe. Just return -1 is not correct.

## Is there are better solution?

I think this algoritm return value after I know the answer. To improve those cases, It is better to write for loop of while loop inside of main function.
If I write this algoritm inside of main function, I can just return the value -1 and end the program.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is 21500749@handong.edu.
Thank you for visiting this github!
